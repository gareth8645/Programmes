# Programmes
Different scritps which i have found and possibly made changes to to enhance...........also because i lost a Kali machine and all that was in it.

In reality I am wanting to break into Cyber security and this is going to end up as a repository for tools and scripts i either make myself or find and are better than what i can do.

One day I will aspire to doing Cyber Security :-)
